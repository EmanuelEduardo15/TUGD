# Deduction of the TUGD Field Equations

Starting from the modified action:
\[
S = \int \sqrt{-g} \left( \mathbb{C}_{\mu\nu} g^{\mu\nu} + \mathcal{L}_m \right) d^4x
\]

Varying with respect to \( g^{\mu\nu} \), we obtain:
\[
\frac{\delta S}{\delta g^{\mu\nu}} = \mathbb{C}_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} T_{\mu\nu} = 0
\]
\implies \mathbb{C}_{\mu\nu} = \frac{1}{2} T_{\mu\nu}
\]
